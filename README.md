## Movies-ETL
#Motivation: 
This Hackathon our teams is tasked with data-cleaning strategies for movie data with the goal of that reconstructing it and compiling the data from various data sources. The content covers a decade of many of the popular films we have watched over the years. 
#Purpose:
Demonstrate the value of data cleaning strategies and the importance of inspecting the data. We have a few data sources and so keep in mind best practices so that our data structure is consistent. 
#Analysis and Challenges:
Data engineering: Extract, Transform, and Load. Extract or gather the data from multiple sources, Transform or manipulate, and finally Load to final destination. This is the process that is known as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). A onetime migration from a database to another, ongoing automated collection of messy, real time data from different resources. Transforming the data by filtering, parsing, translating, sorting, pivoting, aggregating or merging. Finally, loading to a data target; a relational database.
